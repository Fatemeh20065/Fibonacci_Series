🌀 Fibonacci Series Project

📖 Description

🔢 This project reads an integer from user input and prints the Fibonacci series up to that position. 

⚡ The Fibonacci numbers are calculated using a recursive method in C#.

💻 Results are displayed directly in the console.

🛠 Features

Input a single integer (position in the Fibonacci series).

Recursive method Fibonacci() to compute each term.

Print the series up to the given position.

💻 How to Run

Open the project in Visual Studio or any C# IDE.

Copy the code into a .cs file.

Run the program.

Enter a number (e.g., 6).

The program will print the Fibonacci series up to that position.

🧮 Example Output

Enter a number (position in Fibonacci series): 6

Fibonacci series up to position 6:

1 1 2 3 5 8
